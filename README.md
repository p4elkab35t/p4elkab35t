💻 I'm a developer with a passion for clever microservice architecture, system-thinking, cutting-edge technologies, blazingly fast perfomance, buzzword, buzzword, buzzword, buzzword and just enough chaos to build weird bots and beautiful tools.  
Currently based in 🇨🇦 Canada, originally from 🇷🇺 Russia.

I work with:
> `Go` • `TypeScript` • `Svelte` • `Next.js` • `TailwindCSS` • `Bun` • `Docker` • `SQL` • `Git`
